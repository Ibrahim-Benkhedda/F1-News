    <h1>Final Project Report of Web Development</h1>
    <h2>Ibrahim Benkhedda</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <h3>What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to implement?</h3>
      <p>For the project, I decided to make a website newsletter based on Formula F1 International sports. The website presents the latest, Editors and Hot picks that are going on in the world of Formula 1. the website also provides information about the
        upcoming racing events, schedule and current ranking of the Formula 1 Drivers and teams. There is also Information and a timeline of events about the history of Formula sports in general, which Frequently asked questions.
        The Website is divided into 5 pages. Explore, News, Schedule, Ranking and About F1 where each page is structured into 4 main parts: Nav, Header, Main and Footer. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      <h3>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The first one is the official Formula 1 Website. The Website has one of the best designs I've seen, The colour consistency, the typography and the visual hierarchy made the website pleasant to explore which inspired me to make a website that keeps the user engaged.</li>
        <li>The Second one is, The Official Mercedes-Benz Website, The Animation and clean minimalistic UI inspired me to explore more about animations and how to make a simple design while keeping the user engaged.</li>
        <li>The Third one is The Netflix Series of Formula 1, which inspired me to make a website about the beauty and uniqueness of this sport.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
          <h3>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Firstly, Alternative "Alt" texts for images, help screen readers to understand the website content.</li>
            <li>Secondly, The use of semantic tags to structure the content of the web pages.</li>
            <li>Lastly, in Color Contrast, I made sure that the website can be read by every user by keeping the Contrast Ratio 4:5:1.</li>
          </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <h3>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Mobile and Tablet devices compatibility, I made the website responsive to these devices so that a variety of users can access the website through their desired device.</li>
        <li>The Navigation bar and Footer, I created a Navigation bar and a footer for each of the pages to help your user browse through your website with ease with the links that are provided.  I also made the special nav bar for mobile device resolutions so that there's no collapse between elements.</li>
        <li>Simplicity and Relevance, By simplicity I minimized the distraction on the website to let the user focus on what is important and the content and theme of the website are relevant to the users who use this website.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <h3>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Using Grid Layout for 2D Layout, to create the Layout that I wanted for the home page I had to work with a 2D Layout Model, I managed to learn more about it by using MDN Resources and YouTube for a visual explanation</li>
        <li>Transform properties, when I wanted to make animations for images and cards, I learned about Transform properties such as Translate and skew functions to make my images scale when hovered</li>
        <li>FIlters, when I was making the schedule page I wanted to use filters for my images for animation purposes which lead me to discover Filter properties from W3School and MDN Website  </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      <h3>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why</h3>
      <p>The First aspect is mixing Flexbox and Grid Layout, I was surprised at how effective it is to make the desired layout of a page or a card or box by mixing these two models together.
      </p>
      <p>The second aspect would be making the web pages responsive to mobile resolution, tablet and desktop using media queries.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      <h3>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently </h3>
      <p>The first aspect would be using too many nested divs and elements when it's unnecessary. I used many nested divs and elements in the news and home page when it could be avoided which can help me with making the structure of the pages much more organized.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, I underestimated how much time it took to finish the project, which lead me to not having enough time to learn about Event listeners and DOM Javascript which could've helped me with making my website more interactive.
      </p>

      <p>
        The cause of both the two aspects that I mentioned came from not organizing my time for the project. The most important aspect that I would change is create a project schedule such as Gant Chart for better time management.
