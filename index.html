              Daniel Ricciardo will leave McLaren at the end of the season after
              he and the team agreed a mutual early termination of his contract.
              Confirmation of the early split opens the door for Oscar Piastri to
              join the Woking team, although Alpine are still adamant they have a
              contract for their wantaway youngster to stay.
