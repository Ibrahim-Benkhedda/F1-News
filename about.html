      <h3>About Formula One</h3>
      <p>
        F1 has a competition structure that involves 10 teams, with two drivers
        per team. It is effectively a league table format, with points racked up
        over the course of the season (more on that later). The world championship
        was founded in 1950 and is sanctioned by the FIA, which sets the rules and
        regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        F1 cars can accelerate from 0 – 60mph in just 2.6 seconds and clock up to
        360kmph or 223.6mph. The formula one car reaches high speeds because of its
        carefully engineered aerodynamics. Also, the aerodynamics works better when
        the car goes fast.

                <p>
                  Formula One was first defined in 1946 by the Commission Sportive Internationale (CSI) of the FIA,
                  forerunner of FISA, as the premier single-seater racing category in worldwide motorsport to become
                  effective in 1947. This new "International Formula" was initially known variously as Formula A,
                  Formula I, or Formula 1 with the corresponding "Voiturette" formula being titled Formula B, Formula II,
                  or Formula 2

                <p>Formula One entered its second turbocharged era in 2014. Australia was the location of the end of the first era.  All cars entering any Formula One championship race must run with 1.6-litre single turbocharged 6-cylinder engines with a rev limit of 15,000 rpm and maximum fuel flow of 100 kg/hr. New car regulations will also be enforced, and the minimum weight regulations will be raised from 642 kg (1,415 lb) to 690 kg (1,521 lb). Ferrari, Mercedes and Renault produced engines from 2014 with Honda producing engines from 2015</p>

            Formula 1 drivers cannot listen to music while racing or driving a
            Formula machine. solely because the music distracts the drivers as

          <p>
            Most of the time those are just racing incidents and no penalty is applied.
            However if one car  collides directly with another, the stewards will come up
            with an acceptable penalty for that driver and their team.
